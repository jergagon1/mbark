Meetup App for Getting Dogs Together at Dogparks!

Part of Devbootcamp Phase 2 P10 project.

This app will allow users to post messages to other users in the area about dogpark meetups. The initial intent is to practice development skills, but I hope this app will grow into a useful tool.

I will need to put together a working MVP by myself as part of Devbootcamp, but after that contributions and comments are welcome!
